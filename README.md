# This repository is a collection of pages made by imnameddavid and 'named studios.' for their relevant projects.
  
  If you see this, I guess you're a type of guy who loves snooping around the internet, I guess.
  However, if you're viewing this from https://imnameddavid.github.io/index.html, the home website is down for some reason.

## Open Source Information

  These pages are open-source because I can't make this repository private for whatever reason, so instead of attempting to hide this repository, these are open to anyone to look around, and maybe learn what not to do in HTML (because I am trash). However, if you do snoop around:

- Please do not claim these pages as your own, even if you modify them or CTRL+C CTRL+V my work. I don't have lawyers, but you have morality.
- You must give attribution if you do take these pages.
- Please link back to this repository or mention me (@imnameddavid) as the original author.
